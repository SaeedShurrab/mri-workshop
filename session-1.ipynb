    "## Visual acuity \n",
    "\n",
    "Vision is a complex sensation that provides us with a personal conscious representation of our surrounding environment. Loss of vision or blindness may limit a person’s ability to complete normal, daily activities and decrease overall quality of life. Visual impairment can impose various limitations on a person’s functional ability, including reading, mobility (which includes driving), visual information processing (also called “seeing”), and visually guided motor behavior (also called “manipulation”). One core NIH Toolbox vision measure is available with national normative scores provided [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Snellen_chart.svg/1920px-Snellen_chart.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description: \n",
    "This test directly measures participants’ visual acuity or distance vision. The participant is seated 3 meters away from the iPad screen at eye level, and letters (called “optotypes”) are displayed one at a time on the screen for the participant to identify, using both eyes at the same time, with the participant wearing his/her normal corrective lenses for distance vision (glasses or contact lenses), if worn. As the participant successfully identifies optotypes of a given size, smaller ones appear on the screen, until the software ascertains the smallest-size optotype the participant can successfully see. Conversely, the program displays larger optotypes if the participant cannot see the size that is first displayed, until a size that he/she can accurately see is found. For participants ages 3-7, only the letters H, O, T and V are used, and children may point to a laminated card showing the letters if they cannot verbalize or recall the letter names. For participants ages 8 and above, the entire set of optotypes is used, following a common protocol used in professional vision testing. This test takes approximately three minutes to administer and is recommended for ages 3-85. HCP administered the task to participants in both studies (ages 5+), as well as to all able parents from the Development Study [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "The Visual Acuity Test provides a reliable measure of participants’ overall functional distance vision since it measures both eyes simultaneously. In everyday life, a Snellen equivalent of 20/40 or better (including corrective lenses) is typically a requirement of obtaining a motor vehicle license. Federal government definitions of “legally blind” refer to corrected vision in the individual’s better eye of 20/200 and worse [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points:\n",
    "* Provides a quick and accurate assessment of distance vision \n",
    "* Children and older adults have different sets of optotypes or letters \n",
    "* Participants sit 3 meters away from an iPad at eye level \n",
    "* Participants that normally wear glasses for distance vision should use them \n",
    "* Children Ages 3-7 \n",
    "     * can point to a card to show what letter they saw on the screen (H O T V) \n",
    "     * There is a training where the child is encouraged to name the letters. Letter naming is not required \n",
    "     * There is also a practice where a set of 4 letters is presented at 20/400. If the child does not succeed after 3 times, testing is discontinued \n",
    "* Ages 8+ the card is not used \n",
    "* If the participant requires a very strong correction but does not have their corrective lenses, the test is likely invalid \n",
    "* If the participant does wear lenses but are not as strong and forgot them, the examiner makes a judgement call \n",
    "* The letter sets are different for younger and older participants \n",
    "* The test progressively presents smaller letters if the participant is correct, and larger letters if they are wrong, until an acuity score is established and the test ends \n",

    "Participants in the Aging Study, ages 36+ years old, were administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nasreddine et al., 2019) as a broad measure of cognitive status. Participants ages 36-79 years old were excluded if they scored below a 20 out 30 total points. Participants over the age of 79 years old were excluded if they scored below an 18 to account for typical cognitive decline seen in this age range. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "The MoCA is a test that was developed to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on the commonly seen domains of impairment. This test requires an administrator to verbally give directions to a test taker, has a maximum score of 30 points, and is scored across eight cognitive domains: visuospatial abilities, short-term memory, executive function, attention, concentration, working memory, language and orientation. During this task, visuospatial abilities are assessed using a clock-drawing task and a threedimensional cube copy. Short-term memory recall is assessed with a task which involves two learning trials of five nouns and delayed recall after approximately 5 minutes. Multiple aspects of executive functions are assessed using an alternation task adapted from the Trail Making B task, a phonemic fluency task, and a two-item verbal abstraction task. Attention, concentration, and working memory are evaluated using a sustained attention task (target detection using tapping), a serial subtraction task, and repeating lists of digits forward and backward. Language is assessed using a three-item confrontation naming task with low-familiarity animals (i.e. “lion”, “camel”, “rhinoceros”), exact repetition of two syntactically complex sentences, and the aforementioned fluency task. Finally, orientation to time and place is evaluated via verbal responses from the test taker. Item-level responses and scores for this questionnaire can be found in the NDA data structure moca01. For more information about MoCA score range please refer to [2]\n",

    "Handedness was assessed using the 11-item Edinburgh Handedness questionnaire [1]. An adapted 8-item version of the questionnaire was used for subjects 5- to 10-years old where the child pretended to perform activities that required using one-hand (e.g. using a hammer, using scissors). For subjects ages 11+, a combined Edinburgh handedness score (hcp_handedness_score data element) is also provided for harmonization with HCP-Young Adult and =sum(writing, throwing, scissors, toothbrush, knife_no_fork, spoon, broom, match, box, foot), where values for elements are coded left=10, strongly prefer left (spl), usually left=-5, no preference =0, strongly prefer right (spr), usually right=5, and right=10. Missing elements are assigned the median of subject's other summands. For subjects 5- to 10-years old, a combined score of the 8-item version (hand_score data element) is provided and =sum (writing, hammer, throwing, toothbrush, hand5, spoon, scissors, hand_15_drink) where values for elements are coded left=0 and right=1. Missing elements are assigned the median of subject's other summands. Item-level responses and scores for this questionnaire can be found in the NDA data structure edinburgh_hand01. score conversion is performed according to [2]\n",

    "The HCP uses the 60-question version of this questionnaire. It is a quick, reliable, and accurate measure of the 5 broad traits of personality: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness. These 5 broad traits have been generally accepted as describing the personality (Goldberg, 1993; McCrae & Costa, 2004; Costa & McCrae, 2012). NEO was obtained as a self-report from Development participants ages 16+ and all Aging participants ages 36+. This report was administered to participants via an iPad survey from the [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/about/) platform. Responses to questions from this instrument can be found in the NDA data structure nffi01 [1-3].\n",
